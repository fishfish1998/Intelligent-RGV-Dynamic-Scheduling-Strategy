# Intelligent-RGV-Dynamic-Scheduling-Strategy
#These are the codes for the project Intelligent RGV Dynamic Scheduling Strategy in FMS Dual System with Stochastic Breakdown. In this project, we researched the optimal RGV  scheduling strategy for a flexible manufacturing system with breakdowns. We divided the process into two types of unit cycles and proposed an RGV search rule based on a probability model. The codes the written in Matlab to simulate the operation of the system. Our strategy is proved valid, which improved the system’s efficiency by 3.7%.

Ps: There is a long story…I’m likely to have an essay about it! 
This is the expansion of the problem B in the National College Mathematical Modeling Competition of 2018. It is very sad that due to lots of reasons we didn’t finish the solution paper within the required time, although the model and coding were finished →→ So after the contest I modified the solution paper into an academic essay in Oct, 2018 and submitted it to the editor in Beijing personally. But! He made lots of comments and let me modify it……→→ Since I had no time, the modification was started in this November. And today, I submitted it again through email… No matter it will be accepted or not, I think at least the coding is a good work and the people writing them are brilliant (hhhhhhhh)!!!And I want to share it with all people.
